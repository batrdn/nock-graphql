# nock-graphql

A nock-based GraphQL testing library that provides a functionality to mock queries and mutations.
In contrast to Apollo's MockedProvider, nock allows a realistic testing with the actual `http` calls being made from your client code.

When it comes to testing GraphQL endpoints, there are few issues you need to deal with.

1. Parsing query string
2. Adding typenames
